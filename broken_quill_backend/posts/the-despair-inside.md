The despair inside has embezzled from me  
The one thing that was the essence of me  
The sense of self which drove me around  
Is drifting away, no where to be found  

The guilt inside has annihilated me  
Wrecking every last shred of plea  
What am I if not a walking corpse  
Like an empty shell drenched in remorse  

The misery inside has baffled me  
Should I change myself or just let it be  
Cold-hearted, concealed in disguise  
Broke free, as tears rolled down the eyes
